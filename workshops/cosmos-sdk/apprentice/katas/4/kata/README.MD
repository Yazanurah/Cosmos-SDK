# Path of the Apprentice - Queries

This training exercise is a **apprentice-level** course on Cosmos SDK that serves as a starting point for L1 developers looking to onboard the Cosmos.

## Getting started

These instructions will help you prepare for the `training step` and ensure that your training machine has the tools installed you will need to complete the assignment(s). If you find yourself in a situation where one or more tools might not be available for your training environment please reach out to your instructor for assistance on how to proceed, post an [issue in our repository](https://github.com/classic-terra/dojo/issues) or fix it yourself via a [pull request](https://github.com/classic-terra/dojo/pulls).

### Prerequisites

* [Golang](https://go.dev/dl/)
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
* [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) (Windows)

## Preface

`Cosmos SDK` queries are a way to retrieve data from a blockchain network built using the `Cosmos SDK`. The `Cosmos SDK` is a popular blockchain development framework that allows developers to build custom blockchain applications with their own set of rules and features.

In the context of `Cosmos SDK`, queries are used to fetch data from the blockchain's state. The blockchain state is a record of all the transactions that have taken place on the network, along with the current state of all the accounts and other data structures that are relevant to the network.

Queries in `Cosmos SDK` can be used to retrieve information about things like account balances, transaction history, and other data that is stored on the blockchain. Queries can be executed through various channels, including CLI commands, RESTful APIs, and web sockets.

There are several types of queries that can be executed using `Cosmos SDK`, including:

* `Account queries`: These queries allow you to retrieve information about a particular account on the blockchain, including the account balance, transaction history, and other details.

* `Validator queries`: These queries allow you to retrieve information about validators on the blockchain, including their voting power, commission rates, and other details.

* `Block queries`: These queries allow you to retrieve information about specific blocks on the blockchain, including the block height, hash, and other details.

* `Event queries`: These queries allow you to retrieve information about events that have taken place on the blockchain, including transaction events, validator events, and other types of events.

## Exercise

In this exercise we  will learn how to query the blockchain for specific Account using the `clientCtx.QueryWithData()` function and subsequently the `codec.UnmarshalInterface()` function to `deserialize` the `query` response to an instance of the `client.Account` interface.

**Note**: this `training step` assumes that you have set up a working `Cosmos SDK` node and configured the SDK client accordingly. Additionally, you will need to import the appropriate SDK modules and define the token type and decimal places for your specific blockchain network in order for this to be used in production.

### Step 1: Create kata directory

First we setup a directory for our exercise files. It's pretty straight forward:

```bash
mkdir kata4
cd kata4
```

### Step #2: Initialize go module

Now we want to initialize a new `Go` module and install the packages needed for code-generation with our `.proto` files:

```bash
go mod init example.com/queries
go mod edit -replace github.com/99designs/keyring=github.com/cosmos/keyring@v1.2.0
go mod edit -replace github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go=github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v4@v4.4.2
go mod edit -replace github.com/gin-gonic/gin=github.com/gin-gonic/gin@v1.7.0
go mod edit -replace github.com/gogo/protobuf=github.com/regen-network/protobuf@v1.3.3-alpha.regen.1
go mod edit -replace github.com/jhump/protoreflect=github.com/jhump/protoreflect@v1.9.0
go get github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk@v0.45.12
```

### Step #3: Create a file called `main.go`

Then we have to create a file for our program:

```bash
cat > main.go
```

### Step #4: Import required `Go` packages

At the top of `main.go` add an import statement with the `Go` packages neccessary to complete this `training step`:

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
	"fmt"
	"os"

	"github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/client"
	"github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/simapp"
	sdk "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types"
)
```

### Step #5: Add empty main() method

Then create an empty method body below the import statement:

```go
func main() {
}
```

### Step #6: Set up Cosmos SDK

Inside the main method begin by setting up the SDK configuration used by our `training step`:

```go	
// Create a new background context
_ = context.Background()

//Set prefix for config
sdk.GetConfig().SetBech32PrefixForAccount("terra", "terrapub")

//Get simapp encoding configuration
encodingConfig := simapp.MakeTestEncodingConfig()
```

### Step #7: Configure nodeClient & clientContext

Now that we have our basic configuration in place and the keyring is populated with a `dummy account` we can proceed to configure the client our `Go` program will use to communicate with the blockchain:

```go
// Create  node client
nodeClient, err := client.NewClientFromNode("tcp://localhost:26657")
if err != nil {
	fmt.Printf("failed to create node client: %s", err.Error())
	os.Exit(1)
}

// Create a new client context
clientCtx := client.Context{}.
	WithInterfaceRegistry(encodingConfig.InterfaceRegistry).
	WithTxConfig(encodingConfig.TxConfig).
	WithLegacyAmino(encodingConfig.Amino).
	WithCodec(encodingConfig.Marshaler).
	WithClient(nodeClient).
	WithChainID("columbus-5").
	WithSignModeStr("SIGN_MODE_UNSPECIFIED").
	WithBroadcastMode("block")
```

### Step #8: QueryWithData and deserialize response

Finally we can prepare our query arguments and use the `clientCtx.QueryWithData()` function to query the blockchain for the address `terra13vs2znvhdcy948ejsh7p8p22j8l4n4y07062qq`, as follows:

```go
    // Create a address from a string
	queryAddr, err := sdk.AccAddressFromBech32("terra13vs2znvhdcy948ejsh7p8p22j8l4n4y07062qq")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("failed to parse recipient address: %s", err.Error())
		os.Exit(1)
	}

	// Query account information
	res, _, err := clientCtx.QueryWithData(fmt.Sprintf("custom/%s/%s/%s", "bank", "accounts", queryAddr.String()), nil)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("failed to query account: %s", err.Error())
		os.Exit(1)
	}

	// Unmarshal account information
	var account client.Account
	if err := encodingConfig.Marshaler.UnmarshalInterface(res, &account); err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("failed to unmarshal query: %s", err.Error())
		os.Exit(1)
	}

	// Print account information
	fmt.Printf("Account address: %s\n", account.GetAddress())
```

### Step #9: Run `go mod tidy`

To clean up our `dependency graph` and fetch any missing packages we have to run the `go mod tidy` command:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

### Step #10: Build executable

With our code kata finalized all that remains now is to build a new `Go` binary based on `main.go`:

```bash
go build
```

### Step #11: Run executable

Then we can run our new `Go` program with the following command:

```bash
./queries
```

## Conclusion

Queries are an important tool for blockchain developers who want to build applications that interact with the blockchain state. By using queries, developers can retrieve relevant data from the blockchain and use it to build powerful decentralized applications. The `Cosmos SDK` provides a variety of tools and APIs to make it easy to execute queries and retrieve data from the blockchain network.
