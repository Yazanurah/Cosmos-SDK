# Path of the Cosmonaut - IBC

This training exercise is a **cosmonaut-level** course on Cosmos SDK that serves as a starting point for L1 developers looking to onboard the Cosmos.

## Getting started

These instructions will help you prepare for the `training step` and ensure that your training machine has the tools installed you will need to complete the assignment(s). If you find yourself in a situation where one or more tools might not be available for your training environment please reach out to your instructor for assistance on how to proceed, post an [issue in our repository](https://github.com/classic-terra/dojo/issues) or fix it yourself via a [pull request](https://github.com/classic-terra/dojo/pulls).

### Prerequisites

* [Golang](https://go.dev/dl/)
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
* [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) (Windows)

## Preface

In the context of the Cosmos SDK, `IBC` (Inter-Blockchain Communication) refers to a protocol that enables independent blockchain networks to communicate and transfer digital assets and data between each other in a trustless manner.

`IBC` provides a standardized way for blockchains to exchange data and assets, enabling cross-chain interoperability and opening up a wide range of possibilities for decentralized applications.

The `IBC` protocol is based on a set of standard messages and transaction types that enable inter-chain communication. These messages are used to create channels between blockchains, transfer digital assets, and verify the authenticity and integrity of data being transferred.

The `IBC` protocol is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing developers to add new features and functionality as needed. The protocol includes a number of standard modules that provide common functionality, such as authentication and routing, as well as a set of hooks and interfaces that allow developers to customize and extend the protocol to meet their specific needs.

The Cosmos SDK includes a built-in implementation of the `IBC` protocol, making it easy for developers to build cross-chain applications that can interact with other blockchains. The `IBC` implementation in the Cosmos SDK is designed to be scalable, secure, and flexible, enabling developers to build a wide range of cross-chain applications with varying levels of complexity.

Overall, `IBC` in the Cosmos SDK provides a powerful tool for building decentralized applications that can communicate and exchange value with other blockchains, enabling new possibilities for cross-chain collaboration and interoperability.

## Exercise

### Step 1: Create kata directory

First we setup a directory for our exercise files. It's pretty straight forward:

```bash
mkdir kata1
cd kata1
```
